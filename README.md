Hello Everyone!
I am Manish Potdar.
Hope you all are doing well :)
I am writing here to share my experience as a Android Development Intern in the Virtual Internship Program (VIP) at @LetsGrowMore for January 2022.
I would like to thanks Mr. Aman Kesarwani and @LetsGrowMore for giving me this awesome opportunity to enhance my skills and work on such an amazing projects.
During this Android Development Internship we were having 3 levels of tasks, out of which we needed to complete at least 2 of them for the Internship completion & certification from @LetsGrowMore:-
1. Beginner Level
2. Intermediate Level
3. Advance Level
I am so glad that I have completed my 2 tasks:-
->In 1st task ( Covid-19 Tracker App) : Here I developed an Android Application in which the users can track the Covid-19 cases of India in daily basis.
->In 2nd task ( Create a face detection android app using machine learning kit on firebase.) : For this I have used Face Detection concepts of ML kit android using firebase.
It was great working here as a Android Development intern. The overall internship experience was awesome. @LetsGrowMore provides all guidance and support.
I would recommend this internship to everyone who is struggling for an opportunity to gain some knowledge and work on some projects to show hands-on experience on internship for their future endorsement. It would surely boost and help your confidence level to high.
