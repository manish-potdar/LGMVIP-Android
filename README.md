Hello Everyone!
I am Manish Potdar.
Hope you all are doing well :)
I am writing here to share my experience as a Android Development Intern in the Virtual Internship Program (VIP) at LetsGrowMore for January 2022.
I would like to thanks @Aman Kesarwani and @LetsGrowMore for giving me this awesome opportunity to enhance my skills and work on such an amazing projects.
During this Android Development Internship we were having 3 levels of tasks, out of which we needed to complete at least 2 of them for the Internship completion & certification from LetsGrowMore:-
1. Beginner Level
2. Intermediate Level
3. Advance Level
I am so glad that I have completed my 2 tasks:-
->In 1st task ( Iris Flowers Classification ML Project) : This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
->In 2nd task ( Image to Pencil Sketch with Python) : We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.
It was great working here as a Android Development intern. The overall internship experience was awesome. LetsGrowMore provides all guidance and support.
I would recommend this internship to everyone who is struggling for an opportunity to gain some knowledge and work on some projects to show hands-on experience on internship for their future endorsement. It would surely boost and help your confidence level to high.
